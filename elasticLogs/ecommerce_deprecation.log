[2022-07-28T16:26:44,610][CRITICAL][o.e.d.x.s.s.SecurityStatusChangeListener] [Kanisks-MacBook-Pro.local] [] The default behavior of disabling security on basic licenses is deprecated. In a later version of Elasticsearch, the value of [xpack.security.enabled] will default to "true" , regardless of the license level. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/security-minimal-setup.html to enable security, or explicitly disable security by setting [xpack.security.enabled] to false in elasticsearch.yml
